## üöÄ About The Project

In today's world, healthcare data is often scattered across multiple systems, creating barriers to effective patient care. This fragmentation leads to data silos, repeated diagnostic tests, and potential medication errors.

**HealthUnify** solves this problem by creating a patient-centric platform where individuals have complete ownership and control over their health data. By integrating Allopathy, Ayurveda, and Homeopathy, it offers a truly holistic view of a patient's health journey, empowering them and their healthcare providers to make more informed decisions.
